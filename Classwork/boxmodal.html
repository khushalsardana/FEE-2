      <!-- Difference between all of them with the help of example
       Just like dairy milk chocolate
       1) At the core there is chocolate which represents the content html
       2) Then there is a gold foil which covers the chocolate and represents the padding in html
       3) Then there is a white wrapper which covers the gold foil and represents the border in html 
       4) Then there is the main wrapper of purple colour and represents the margin in html-->
